    "The tweet history of Twitter user @dog rates, otherwise known as WeRateDogs, is a dataset that will only be very useful for various purposes only when properly wrangled. Applying the knowledge from python and its libraries, we can make the cleaning of these data.\n",

    "In the sections below, first, all the three pieces of data for this project are gathered and loaded into Jupyter notebook using appropriate methods required to gather each data. Secondly, data assessment is a critical aspect of data wrangling process. By this assessment, whether by visual or done programmatically, are critical for identifying data quality and tidy issues for documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cleaning section, all the issues documented while assessing were cleaned after a copy of the original data was made. Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data. Then the result, which a better-quality and tidy master_data pandas DataFrame (or DataFrame) were stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the analysis and visuals of the wrangled data was made to give detailed insight that can be applied by companies that provides goods and services for the promotion of their products such as dog food and accessories sales, and healthcare services. When such opportunities are maximized and products well marketed on Twitter at such time, there is a probability of increased sales and possibly income.\n",

    "The observation here is that the first month has the highest record of tweets. This can be attributed to the season of love that is an extension from the Christmas season and holiday coupled with the cold weather in some countries. During this time, family, and friend (and by extension pets such as dogs) are shown some care and love. Secondly, during this holiday season, friends and family spend quality time with each other, and that includes their dogs. Hence, at this time lots of tweets about dogs are recorded on Twitter page. It is important that companies involved in dog foods, accessories, products, and healthcare can maximize such opportunities to do a huge promo on their products because many dog owners have the time and pay more attention to them. As the love and care during this season may be extended to their pets and can be demonstrated by treating their dogs with new product or in a special way."
